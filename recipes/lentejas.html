            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>For 4 people</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>3 carrots</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>3 spanish chorizo (Some are spicy, so choose wisely)</li>
                <li>500gr of spanish pardina lentils (often harder than indian lentils)</li>
                <li>Salt, pepper and sweet paprika. Preferably smoked paprika from La Vera.</li>
                <li>1L of vegetables stock (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Note: Make sure your chorizo is raw, not cured. Depending on the variety, you may or may not need to soak the lentils overnight (for example, pardina lentils don't need to be soaked), check the packaging. Above all, wash the lentils before use.</em></p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop the vegetables. In a cooking pot, add a few tablespoons of olive oil and the onion, after a few minutes add the carrots and the garlic. </li>
                <li>When the vegetables are partially cooked, add the sliced chorizo. Cook the chorizo until sealed.</li>
                <li>Add the lentils along with the vegetables and the chorizo. This process is called "rehogar", stir the ingredients gently for a few minutes or until the lentils appear lightly toasted.</li>
                <li>Add salt, pepper and spices as desired but <b>not the paprika</b>. Refrain from adding curry, turmeric or similar spices, but some herbs or hot spices are welcome in moderation.</li>
                <li>Be prepared! Add the paprika but be careful, if the paprika is smoked it is already cooked, which means that it burns easily and in that case its taste is not pleasant. Just 15 to 20 seconds after adding the paprika, add at least two measures of stock for every one measure of lentils.</li>
                <li>Bring to the boil and cook over low heat for the time indicated by the evoltory. Sometimes the cooking time will depend on the variety of lentil and the hardness of the water, although generally it will be a minimum of 40 minutes in a conventional pot (not express).</li>
                <li>Wait for it to cook and enjoy!</li>
