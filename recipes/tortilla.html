    <p><em>The star of the Spanish cuisine<br>every mother makes it diferent<br>every foreigner does it wrong</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For a medium size tortilla</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>4 or 5 Potatoes</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>6 eggs at room temperature</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Julienne the onion. Wash, peel and cut the potatoes into irregular pieces. You can use the legendary Spanish technique of grabbing the potato with one hand and slicing it with the other.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the potato and onion.</li>
        <li>Put the potato and onion in a frying pan with hot oil. The ingredients should be covered by the oil, not submerged in it. Cook over a medium heat for 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the ingredients from the pan into the bowl. Allow to cool for a minute, then break the eggs over the fried mixture. Mix everything together before the eggs start to cook.</li>
        <li>When it's all mixed together, let it sit for two or three minutes. The heat will make the eggs stick to the vegetables. After this you can add salt and pepper and taste, the egg is no longer raw.</li>
        <li>Heat a <b>non-stick frying pan</b> with a little oil. Make sure the pan is hot before pouring the mixture.</li>
        <li>Don't rest on your laurels! The tortilla must not be overcooked, after 3 to 5 minutes in the pan, turn it over with the help of a plate. Put it back in the pan and cook for another 2 minutes, but no longer.</li>
        <li>Pop out of the frying pan and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
